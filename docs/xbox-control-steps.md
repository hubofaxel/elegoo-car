# 🎮 Mission: Xbox Controller Robot Control\! 🤖

Hey there, young robotics engineer\! Ready to turn your Elegoo robot car into an Xbox-controlled speed machine? This is going to be AWESOME\! Let's break this down into fun missions that you can complete step by step.

## 🚀 Mission Overview: What We're Building

You're going to make your robot car respond to your Xbox controller wirelessly\! Here's the cool part: your robot has TWO brains (microcontrollers):

- **Brain \#1 (Arduino Uno)**: Controls the wheels and sensors  
- **Brain \#2 (ESP32)**: Handles wireless stuff like Bluetooth

jjWe're going to teach Brain \#2 to talk to your Xbox controller, then tell Brain \#1 what to do\!

## 📋 Pre-Mission Checklist

### What You'll Need:

- [ ] Your Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit V4 (fully assembled)  
- [ ] Xbox Wireless Controller (Model 1708 or newer \- check the back\!)  
- [ ] A computer with Arduino IDE installed  
- [ ] USB cable for programming  
- [ ] Fresh batteries in your robot  
- [ ] A grown-up to help with some steps

### Safety First\! 🦺

## 🎯 Mission 1: Set Up Your Command Center (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Arduino IDE (if not already done)

1. Go to [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
2. Download the version for your computer  
3. Install it (ask for help if needed)

### Step 2: Add the Special ESP32 Tools

This is like downloading a new game mod \- we need special tools to talk to the ESP32\!

1. **Open Arduino IDE**  
     
2. **Go to Settings:**  
     
   - Windows/Linux: Click `File` → `Preferences`  
   - Mac: Click `Arduino IDE` → `Settings`

   

3. **Add the Magic URLs:**  
     
   - Find the box labeled "Additional Board Manager URLs"  
   - Copy and paste BOTH of these URLs (put a comma between them):

   

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package\_esp32\_index.json,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardoquesada/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/master/bluepad32\_files/package\_esp32\_bluepad32\_index.json

   

   - Click "OK"

   

4. **Install the Board Packages:**  
     
   - Go to `Tools` → `Board` → `Boards Manager...`  
   - Search for "esp32"  
   - Install "esp32 by Espressif Systems" (this might take a few minutes)  
   - Search for "esp32\_bluepad32"  
   - Install "ESP32 \+ Bluepad32 Arduino by Ricardo Quesada"  
   - Close the Boards Manager

### 🎉 Checkpoint 1: Can you see "ESP32 \+ Bluepad32 Arduino" in your Tools → Board menu? If yes, Mission 1 complete\!

---

## 🎮 Mission 2: Prepare Your Xbox Controller (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Your Controller

1. Flip your Xbox controller over  
2. Look for the model number (should be 1708, 1914, or newer)  
3. If it's older, it won't work \- you'll need a newer one with Bluetooth

### Step 2: Update Controller Firmware (Optional but recommended)

1. If you have an Xbox or Windows PC, connect your controller with USB  
2. Let it update automatically  
3. This makes sure it works better with Bluetooth

### Step 3: Practice Pairing Mode

1. Turn on your controller (Xbox button)  
2. Press and hold the small pairing button (near the USB port) for 3 seconds  
3. The Xbox logo should flash quickly \- that means it's ready to pair\!

## 💻 Mission 3: Program the ESP32 (The Bluetooth Brain) (45 minutes)

### Step 1: Select the Right Board

1. In Arduino IDE, go to `Tools` → `Board` → `ESP32 + Bluepad32 Arduino` → `ESP32 Wrover Module`

### Step 2: Copy the ESP32 Code

Create a new sketch (File → New) and delete everything. Then copy this ENTIRE code:

\#include \<Bluepad32.h\>

// This will hold our controller

ControllerPtr myController;

// This runs when a controller connects

void onConnectedController(ControllerPtr ctl) {

    Serial.println("YES\! Controller connected\!");

    myController \= ctl;

}

// This runs when a controller disconnects

void onDisconnectedController(ControllerPtr ctl) {

    Serial.println("Oh no\! Controller disconnected\!");

    myController \= nullptr;

}

void setup() {

    // Start talking to the computer and Arduino

    Serial.begin(115200);

    Serial.println("Robot starting up...");

    

    // Set up Bluepad32

    BP32.setup(\&onConnectedController, \&onDisconnectedController);

    

    // Forget old controllers (clean slate\!)

    BP32.forgetBluetoothKeys();

    

    Serial.println("Ready to pair with Xbox controller\!");

}

void loop() {

    // Check for controller updates

    BP32.update();

    

    // If controller is connected, read it\!

    if (myController && myController-\>isConnected()) {

        processGamepad();

    }

    

    // Small delay to keep things smooth

    delay(20);

}

void processGamepad() {

    // Read the joysticks

    int leftY \= myController-\>axisY();      // Left stick up/down

    int rightY \= myController-\>axisRY();    // Right stick up/down

    

    // Convert joystick values to motor speeds

    int leftSpeed \= map(leftY, \-1023, 1023, \-255, 255);

    int rightSpeed \= map(rightY, \-1023, 1023, \-255, 255);

    

    // Dead zone \- ignore tiny movements

    if (abs(leftSpeed) \< 20\) leftSpeed \= 0;

    if (abs(rightSpeed) \< 20\) rightSpeed \= 0;

    

    // Send commands to Arduino

    Serial.print("L"); Serial.println(leftSpeed);

    Serial.print("R"); Serial.println(rightSpeed);

    

    // Special moves with buttons\!

    if (myController-\>a()) {

        Serial.println("S");  // Spin move\!

    }

    

    if (myController-\>b()) {

        Serial.println("D");  // Dance move\!

    }

}

### Step 3: Upload to ESP32

1. **IMPORTANT**: Disconnect the robot's battery first\!  
2. The ESP32 is the board on TOP of your Arduino  
3. You DON'T need to remove it \- just plug the USB into the bottom Arduino  
4. Click the Upload button (→ arrow)  
5. **Watch for**: "Connecting..." message \- you might need to press the small "EN" button on the ESP32 when you see dots appearing

### 🎉 Checkpoint 2: Did it say "Done uploading"? Awesome\! ESP32 is ready\!

    // Quick beep to show we're ready (if you have a buzzer)

    Serial.println("Arduino ready\!");

}

void loop() {

    // Check for commands from ESP32

    if (Serial.available() \> 0\) {

        String command \= Serial.readStringUntil('\\n');

        command.trim();

        

        char cmd \= command.charAt(0);

        

        if (cmd \== 'L' || cmd \== 'R') {

            // Motor speed command

            int speed \= command.substring(1).toInt();

            setMotorSpeed(cmd, speed);

        } 

        else if (cmd \== 'S') {

            // Spin move\!

            executeSpin();

        }

        else if (cmd \== 'D') {

            // Dance move\!

            performDance();

        }

    }

}

void setMotorSpeed(char motor, int speed) {

    // Keep speed in valid range

    speed \= constrain(speed, \-255, 255);

    

    if (motor \== 'L') {

        // Left motor

        if (speed \>= 0\) {

            digitalWrite(BIN1, HIGH);

            analogWrite(PWMB, speed);

        } else {

            digitalWrite(BIN1, LOW);

            analogWrite(PWMB, abs(speed));

        }

    } 

    else if (motor \== 'R') {

        // Right motor

        if (speed \>= 0\) {

            digitalWrite(AIN1, HIGH);

            analogWrite(PWMA, speed);

        } else {

            digitalWrite(AIN1, LOW);

            analogWrite(PWMA, abs(speed));

        }

    }

}

void executeSpin() {

    // Spin in place\!

    setMotorSpeed('L', 255);

    setMotorSpeed('R', \-255);

    delay(1000);

    setMotorSpeed('L', 0);

    setMotorSpeed('R', 0);

}

void performDance() {

    // Do a little dance\!

    setMotorSpeed('L', 200);

    setMotorSpeed('R', 200);

    delay(500);

    

    setMotorSpeed('L', \-200);

    setMotorSpeed('R', \-200);

    delay(500);

    

    setMotorSpeed('L', \-255);

    setMotorSpeed('R', 255);

    delay(750);

    

    setMotorSpeed('L', 0);

    setMotorSpeed('R', 0);

}

### Step 3: Upload to Arduino

## 🔧 Mission 6: Troubleshooting Guide

### "My controller won't connect\!"

1. **Reset the ESP32** by pressing the EN button  
2. **Make sure** you selected the Bluepad32 board when uploading to ESP32  
3. **Try forgetting** the controller on any other devices (phone, Xbox, PC)  
4. **Check battery** levels in both controller and robot

### "The robot doesn't move\!"

1. **Check the battery** \- is it charged and switched on?  
2. **Test with Serial Monitor**:  
   - Open Tools → Serial Monitor  
   - Set baud rate to 115200  
   - You should see messages when pressing controller buttons  
3. **Check motor connections** \- are all wires secure?

### "It moves the wrong way\!"

- **Easy fix\!** Swap the two motor wires on the terminal that's going backward

### "It's jerky or laggy\!"

1. **Move closer** to the robot  
2. **Check for interference** \- move away from WiFi routers  
3. **Fresh batteries** in both controller and robot
